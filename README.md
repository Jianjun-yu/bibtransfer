---- This file strips fields from a biblatex file. The original code was written by astrobel found here: 
https://forums.zotero.org/discussion/22629/bibtex-export-request-option-to-omit-certain-fields-for-less-cluttered-bibliographies  
---- Jake Chanenson made the code more robust by modifying it to run from the command line, automatic outputfile creation, giving options on what to strip 
and taking in multiple fields to strip. The code can be found here:
https://github.com/JakeC007/Biblatex-Field-Stripper
---- I moderate the code to fit political science's journals and add a new function to moderate date format. I also change a lopp to make the code more efficient and fix a small problem that lead to failure of removing abstract.
